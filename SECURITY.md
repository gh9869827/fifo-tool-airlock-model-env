This project is in early development. Only the current release (`v0.1.1`) is available and supported.

Version `0.1.0` is no longer supported due to outdated documentation. The README in version `0.1.1` provides clearer descriptions of the system's security and isolation characteristics.

This project is maintained in my spare time. I'll do my best to review and respond to reports, but response times may vary.
