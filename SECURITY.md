|------------|--------------------|
| 0.1.0      | ❌ No               |

This project is in early development. Only the current release (`v0.1.2`) is available and supported.

Versions `0.1.0` and `0.1.1` are no longer supported due to outdated documentation.  
Version `0.1.2` adds a **Project Status, Scope & Audience** section, updates the **Architecture Overview** to include the target environment configuration, and clarifies default user assumptions in the **Prerequisites** section.
